```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(bench)

expense <- read_csv(here("day_01", "aoc_01.txt"), col_names = "fee1")
```

### Part 1

```{r}
expense %>%
  crossing(fee2 = .$fee1) %>%
  filter(fee1 + fee2 == 2020) %>%
  mutate(product = fee1 * fee2)
```

### Part 2

```{r}
expense %>%
  crossing(fee2 = .$fee1) %>%
  crossing(fee3 = .$fee1) %>%
  filter(fee1 + fee2 + fee3 == 2020) %>%
  mutate(product = fee1 * fee2 * fee3)
```

### More thoughts

Try a faster way???

Work out what you need to add to each value in fee vector and then intersect this with fee vector.

Yup - faster. But how to do this with part 2???

```{r}
bench::mark(
  original = {
    expense %>%
      crossing(fee2 = .$fee1) %>%
      filter(fee1 + fee2 == 2020) %>%
      pull(fee1) %>%
      prod()
  },
  faster = {
    intersect(expense$fee1, 2020 - expense$fee1) %>%
      prod()
  }
)
```
