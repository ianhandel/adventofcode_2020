library(simecol)

room <- read_lines(here("day_11", "day11.txt")) %>%
  map(~ str_split(.x, "", simplify = TRUE)) %>%

If a seat is empty (L) and there are no occupied seats adjacent to it,
the seat becomes occupied.

If a seat is occupied (\#) and four or more seats adjacent to it are
also occupied, the seat becomes empty.

## Part 1

Rather than the rubbish solution Iâ€™d code, letâ€™s try using simecolâ€¦

``` r
sims <- 200
seating <- new("gridModel",
    main = function(time, init, parms) {
        x   <- init
        n   <- nrow(x)
        m   <- ncol(x)
        nb  <- eightneighbours(x[] == 2)
        ## seat rule
        x <- case_when(x == 0 ~ 0,
                       x == 1 & nb == 0 ~ 2,
                       x == 2 & nb >= 4 ~ 1,
                       TRUE ~ x)
        dim(x) <- c(n,m)
    x
    },
    times = c(from=1, to=sims, by=1),
    init = room,
    solver = "iteration"
)

sim(seating)@out[sims] %>% table()
```
