If a seat is empty (L) and there are no occupied seats adjacent to it, the seat becomes occupied.

If a seat is occupied (#) and four or more seats adjacent to it are also occupied, the seat becomes empty.

## Part 1

Rather than the rubbish solution I'd code, let's try using simecol...

```{r}
sims <- 200
seating <- new("gridModel",
    main = function(time, init, parms) {
        x   <- init
        n   <- nrow(x)
        m   <- ncol(x)
        nb  <- eightneighbours(x[] == 2)
        ## seat rule
        x <- case_when(x == 0 ~ 0,
                       x == 1 & nb == 0 ~ 2,
                       x == 2 & nb >= 4 ~ 1,
                       TRUE ~ x)
        dim(x) <- c(n,m)
    x
    },
    times = c(from=1, to=sims, by=1),
    init = room,
    solver = "iteration"
)

sim(seating)@out[sims] %>% table()

```

## Part 2



```{r}
# make search vectors
search <- 
  expand.grid(dc = -1:1,
            dr = -1:1) %>%
  filter(!(dc ==0 & dr == 0)) %>% 
  mutate(direction = 1:8)

check_seat <- function(r, c){
  if (c <= 0 | c > ncol(room)) return(0) # outside room
  if (r <= 0 | r > nrow(room)) return(0) # outside room
  return(room[r, c])
}


# code 1 or 3 for empty
# code 2 or 4 for full
# first bit now second bit next

for(ii in 1:100){

  room2 <- room

for (row in 1:nrow(room)) {
  for (col in 1:ncol(room)) {
    nfull <- 0
    for (direction in 1:8) {
      for (step in 1:max(nrow(room), ncol(room))) {
        status <- check_seat(
          c = col + step * search$dc[direction == search$direction],
          r = row + step * search$dr[direction == search$direction]
        )
        if (status %in% 1:2) {
          break()
        }
      }
      if (status == 2) nfull <- nfull + 1
    }
    if (room[row, col] == 2 & nfull >= 5) room2[row, col] <- 1
    if (room[row, col] == 1 & nfull == 0) room2[row, col] <- 2
  }
}

room <- room2

}

table(room)

```
